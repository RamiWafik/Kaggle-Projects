  <h1>Housing Prices Prediction</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to the Housing Prices Prediction repository! This project focuses on predicting housing prices using machine learning techniques. It is based on the well-known Kaggle competition "Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users".

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In this project, we aim to build a model that accurately predicts the prices of residential houses using a given set of features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, etc. The dataset used for this project is included in this repository. Included also a data description file where you can find the description for each feature.
